**#Sign Up Form**

**##Introduction**
In this project I built a sign-up form to collect user information using HTML form controls. In addition to this, I used different client side form validations to make sure users entered the correct data before it is sent to the backend.

The full implementation of the project can be found [here](https://wilsonsiaw.github.io/sign-up-form/).
